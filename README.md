Assignment 1 - The Bohr atom.

The brief is to write a C++ program to calculate the energy for a transition

I first began by learning how to ask the user to enter the various variables and how to define constants (using double data types rather than floats due to ChatGPT suggestion.
This later extends to variables that decide what units the energy is returned in and whether to make another calculation.

The computation of the transistion energy in eV was programmed followed by the output of it in either eV or Joules.
Then the decision to remain or leave the calulation loop was implemented.

The testing of and recovery for all user inputted variables was developed.

Output of transition energy in Joules was later changed to standard form.

  - It helped me learn the basics of C++, for example how to output (```std::cout <<```)
  - It helped me understand the compiler configuration. I originally had strawberry pearl installed which was causing issues.
